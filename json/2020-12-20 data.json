No matter how different we appear, we're all the same in our struggle against the powers of evil and darkness. I hope that this day will always be a day of joy in which we can reconfirm our dedication and our courage. And more than anything else, our love for one another. This is the promise of the Tree of Life. Today, retired filmmaker GEORGE LUCAS (dead-eyed character actor CONNOR RATLIFF) and his talk show sidekick, WATTO (GRIFFIN NEWMAN, co-lead on AMAZON'S THE TICK) are raising money for FEEDING AMERICA. If you know anyone who might want to donate even as little as one dollar, please steer them towards this fundraiser today. They are joined, as always, by their snack-napping, nap-snacking producer PATRICK COTNOIR (aka PITY PAT aka THE GRIM SLEEPER aka STEAMBOOT LICKEY) whose druthers include you following him on twitter right now please: @patrickcotnoir Yippeeeee!.
