When Muyun first woke up, he was deliberately bothered by the student Miaoxianyu. Muyun easily completed the Miaoxianyu trap, and he gave more and more alchemy skills by analogy, so the Alchemy masters outside the door could not ask for appreciation. Endless back home, Mu Yun learns that he is about to marry Nona Qin Qin Mengyao. Qin Mengyao was cold and toxic, but could not live until he was 20 years old. The marriage was only for the sake of pastoralists and family of Qin. However, under Mu Linchen's enticement, Mu Yun approves the family's issue on the condition of alchemy.</p><p><br />\u00a0</p>",

In the first half, we will focus on physical geography or the processes and phenomena of the physical world both above and below the Earth's surface. We'll ask questions like, \"why is the seafloor so young when the Earth is so old?\" or try to identify why winds and ocean currents are so important to life on Earth. Then we'll turn our focus to human geography and explore the ways people occupy the Earth's surface. Like how we've moved, settled, and used the land, resources and space. But ther'e not always a clear line dividing the physical and human, because really, geography is telling the story of the Earth. We'll hope you'll join us on this journey starting November 30, 2020!</p>",
