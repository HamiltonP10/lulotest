Ma Zhai Xing (Li Qin) is the daughter of an official and as a child, she befriends a young boy (Darren Wang) who lives in the mountain. One day when he saves a wolf, he accidentally falls over the cliff and is rescued by Zhu Wen. The authoritative figure adopts him as a godson and gives him the title Bo Wang. Ten years later, he saves the female lead per chance and finds her courage and intelligence resonant, and she likes that while he's in a position of power, he still has humility and kindness. She encourages him to fight for justice and he begins that journey by helping the people, stopping throne fights, etc. Even when they have conflicts, they will face those frankly. As they overcome obstacles and fight for justice, feelings deepen and they are able to reap their own happiness by each other's side.</p>",

Ma Zhai Xing (Li Qin) is the daughter of an official and as a child, she befriends a young boy (Darren Wang) who lives in the mountain. One day when he saves a wolf, he accidentally falls over the cliff and is rescued by Zhu Wen. The authoritative figure adopts him as a godson and gives him the title Bo Wang. Ten years later, he saves the female lead per chance and finds her courage and intelligence resonant, and she likes that while he's in a position of power, he still has humility and kindness. She encourages him to fight for justice and he begins that journey by helping the people, stopping throne fights, etc. Even when they have conflicts, they will face those frankly. As they overcome obstacles and fight for justice, feelings deepen and they are able to reap their own happiness by each other's side.</p>",
