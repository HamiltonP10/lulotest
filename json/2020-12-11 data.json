The Colombians smoked plantain, the Irish sipped beer, and the Chinese ate noodles. But one day the evil Russian Communists came and brought sugar with them. They slaughtered all the street vendors of plantain, seized control of the production of matryoshka dolls (a traditional Yugoslav business) and got the whole city hooked on white powder.</p><p>This will be the last case for Eustace Lynch. Famous for his lucky tattoo, an Irish gangster comes to Lytk-Angeles from Dublin (also known as Dubna) to get rid of the Communists. At the same time, Sally Raptor, a police officer from palm beach (also known as Gelendzhik) arrives in the city with a similar task.</p><p>Zakon i Besporyadok is a parody of the films of the 80s and 90s that we watched on videotapes with one-voice voice-over as a child, and a tribute to that forever-gone era when the screen belonged entirely to evil Russians, Asian martial artists and drinking detectives in ridiculous hats. Each episode parodies one of your favorite genres: the characters don't change, but they end up in an Asian fighting game, a crime Thriller, or even a neo-noir story.</p>",

Ma Zhai Xing (Li Qin) is the daughter of an official and as a child, she befriends a young boy (Darren Wang) who lives in the mountain. One day when he saves a wolf, he accidentally falls over the cliff and is rescued by Zhu Wen. The authoritative figure adopts him as a godson and gives him the title Bo Wang. Ten years later, he saves the female lead per chance and finds her courage and intelligence resonant, and she likes that while he's in a position of power, he still has humility and kindness. She encourages him to fight for justice and he begins that journey by helping the people, stopping throne fights, etc. Even when they have conflicts, they will face those frankly. As they overcome obstacles and fight for justice, feelings deepen and they are able to reap their own happiness by each other's side.</p>",

Ma Zhai Xing (Li Qin) is the daughter of an official and as a child, she befriends a young boy (Darren Wang) who lives in the mountain. One day when he saves a wolf, he accidentally falls over the cliff and is rescued by Zhu Wen. The authoritative figure adopts him as a godson and gives him the title Bo Wang. Ten years later, he saves the female lead per chance and finds her courage and intelligence resonant, and she likes that while he's in a position of power, he still has humility and kindness. She encourages him to fight for justice and he begins that journey by helping the people, stopping throne fights, etc. Even when they have conflicts, they will face those frankly. As they overcome obstacles and fight for justice, feelings deepen and they are able to reap their own happiness by each other's side.</p>",

It is the story of Javier's mother he never knew, Amelia Garayoa. Before fate can finally reunite mother and son, Amelia will have taken a long journey, starting in tumultuous Madrid of 1934. First forced into marriage, then with her newborn baby taken from her, well-off Amelia meets Pierre, a charismatic young French journalist and revolutionary whom Amelia accompanies to Buenos Aires out of love and sheer lust for adventure. There, opera diva Carla Alessandrini takes Amelia under her arm, becoming the young Spanish woman's surrogate mother and best friend. Amelia's lifelong personal, romantic and political journey as a spy for a noble cause eventually takes her full circle back home to Madrid--but not before life-changing experiences every step of the way in Moscow, London, Rome, Paris and Berlin.</p>",
