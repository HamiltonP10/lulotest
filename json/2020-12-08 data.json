The young lovers Helen and Sava\u015f, who have just stepped foot into the real world, find themselves in the middle of difficult situations after being mistreated by a group of people and end up being responsible for a chain of murders that take place in Istanbul.

As for the mediatic follow up, Turkey's most famous morning show host, Hasret will undertake it, however, nobody knows that she is also about to take part in this journey on another level. By getting to the core of this obsession, we will be witnessing the reflection it has on society.</p>",
